      Dark days and wet asphalt<br>
      follow me uninvited.<br>
      And the sounds are unpleasant: there is a viola,<br>
      There is no soprano at all,
      </p>
      <p>
      And not to say that, unfortunately<br>
      The dark forest is so beautiful<br>
      and the sky is grey, that pours down tears on us, it is also sad.<br>
      it did not choose its colour and shape,<br>
      and all hate it for what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is unfair,<br>
      although there are those who love the grey and they are inspired like that:<br>
      when the clouds are sad in nature<br>
      on the very rude note<br>
      And when they happily sit.
      </p>
      <p>
      We need to appreciate and love<br>
      all the things that we take for granted,<br> indeed, in one moment it can just so happen<br> that everything will cease to be.

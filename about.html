      Ekaterina Valui is a writer, director and entrepreneur. 
      Based in Belarus, in the city of Minsk, her latest works presented on this page are comments on the human condition and social problems. 
      Her passion for writing poetry and doing creative work followed thanks to her grandfather, who unfortunately is no longer there.
       Her interest stemmed from a desire to express her thoughts and make sure that her grandfather's name was not forgotten, therefore the name of the site "NikolaY" came from this.
